'''In each of the parts below, I have provided a function definition (with the
correct arguments but no implementation) and some tests that will pass *if* 
you fill in the correct implementation for each function. If you run this file
(i.e. run `python clustering_exercise.py` from your shell) and it does not throw
any errors, then you have finished the exercise!
